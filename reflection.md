What Copilot generated
Which functions or code blocks came primarily from Copilot’s suggestions? How did you prompt it (comments, partial code, etc.)?
What you modified
What changes did you make to Copilot’s code (renaming variables, changing logic, simplifying steps)? Why were those changes needed?
What you learned
What did you learn about data cleaning in Python and about using Copilot as a tool (strengths and limitations)? Include at least one specific example.

In my project I used CoPilot to generate blocks of code and to make suggestions to make my project better. It is a but tricky navigating the different screens and interfaces on VS code but by following the directions on the assingment and help from CoPilot I was able to sucessfully generate my code. The AI maily generated the cleaning steps and put the code into proper format to read properly. Along with suggestions on cleaning up the formatting of the code I had originally put in.
    Some things the AI struggled with was setting up the pandas and file names. I took its suggestions of setting it up but manually downloaded an extension and put the correct file names as it gave me a generic name and format that did not match. 
I learned a lot about CoPilot and using its built in features to help me with my work. First off I would say always double check the work as it can be false and is just generative based off the research tools it is given. One strength is simplifying big blocks and directions and explaining exactly what it is doing to the code. One limitation is it may not know the correct way and can be generating from a false source. Many times it gave my gave an error because the file names did not match but it did not know my files personally so had its limitations.
